# Sarcasm-Detection
This project focuses on detecting sarcasm in text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques. Sarcasm detection is a challenging task in sentiment analysis since sarcastic statements often express the opposite of their literal meaning. 
🚀 Features

Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Word embeddings using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT

Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)

Deep learning models (LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN, or Transformer-based models)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Visualization of data distribution and model performance

📊 Dataset

The project uses a labeled sarcasm dataset, such as the News Headlines Dataset for Sarcasm Detection (from Kaggle or JSON sources). It contains headlines with binary labels indicating whether the text is sarcastic or not.

🧩 Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch, NLTK, SpaCy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📈 Results

The model achieves strong performance in distinguishing sarcastic from non-sarcastic statements, demonstrating the potential of NLP-based sarcasm detection in improving sentiment-aware applications.

🧑‍💻 Future Work

Fine-tuning Transformer models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)

Expanding dataset with diverse sources (tweets, Reddit comments, etc.)

Deploying as a web API or chatbot integration
